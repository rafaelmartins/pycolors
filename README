PyColors

Python module to ease the use of colors on programs that run on CLI.
Works fine on Linux or on any Operating System running BaSH or compatibles.
If the shell's not color compatible, he'll get the raw string.
The module have predefined some basic colors, but you can use any color,
if you know the color code.

Example:
    
    >>> from colors import Color
    >>> yellow = Color('1;33')
    >>> print yellow('Hello World')
    Hello World
    
    >>> from colors import red
    >>> print red('Ola Mundo')

The function disable_colors forces the non-usage of colors. You can also
disable colors setting the environment variable DISABLE_COLORS with any
value.
